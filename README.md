# HFT/Quant_Companies_Optiver_Mock_Online_Round_Score_Screenshots


The aim of this mock online round/test is to solve 80 mental arithmetic questions within 8 minutes. In my fourth attempt at the mock online round/test for the Optiver Quant company, I scored 74/80 marks, which came from correctly answering 77 questions (+1 for each correct response) out of a total of 80 questions, with a -2 penalty for each wrong answer.
